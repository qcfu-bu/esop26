\TLLC{} is a linear dependently typed programming language which extends the TLL
type theory with dependent session types. Through examples, we demonstrate how
dependent session types can be effectively applied to verify concurrent
programs. The expressive power of Martin-L\"{o}f style dependency allows \TLLC{}
session types to capture the expected semantics of concurrent programs. This
results in greater verification precision and flexibility when compared to other
type systems with more restricted forms of dependency. We study the meta-theory
of \TLLC{} and show that it is sound as both a term calculus and also as a
process calculus. A prototype compiler is implemented which compiles \TLLC{}
programs into safe concurrent C code.

A direction of research we intend to explore is the integration of dependency
with multi-party session types~\cite{honda16}. Protocols expressed through such
a session type system will be able to coordinate interactions between processes
from a global viewpoint. We predict dependency will again play a key role in
verifying the correctness of multi-party concurrent computation.
