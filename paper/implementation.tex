We implement a prototype compiler for \TLLC{}. The main components of the compiler
are written in OCaml while a minimalistic runtime library is implemented in C.
The compiler takes \TLLC{} source files as input and generates safe C code which
can be further compiled into executable binaries on POSIX compliant systems.
In this section, we give an overview of the inference, linearity checking
and optimization phases of the compiler.

\paragraph{\textbf{Inference}}
To reduce code duplication and type annotation burden, we implement two forms of inference: 
(1) automatic instantiation of \emph{sort-polymorphic schemes} similarly to the TLL compiler and 
(2) elaboration of inferred arguments.

Consider the identity function below:
\begin{align*}
  \Def\ \textsf{id}\flq{s}\frq\ \%\!\{ A : \textsf{Type}\flq{s}\frq\}\ (x : A) : A := x
\end{align*}
